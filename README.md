## Projects

### Sign-Language Detection
This project leverages machine learning to enable the detection of sign language gestures. I actively contributed to the programming aspects, crafting algorithms to improve detection accuracy. Additionally, I was involved in the collection of datasets which were vital for training our models.

- **Technologies Used:** Python, Machine Learning, OpenCV
- **My Contributions:**
  - Programming of detection algorithms
  - Collection and preprocessing of dataset
- **GitHub Repo:** [Sign-Language Detection](https://github.com/naeem0512/Sign-Language)
