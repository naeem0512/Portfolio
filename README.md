## Projects

### Sign-Language Detection
**Project Overview:**
Imagine a world where communication barriers are shattered and inclusivity is the norm. This project aims to bridge the gap between the hearing and the hearing-impaired communities by leveraging cutting-edge technology. By using machine learning, weâ€™ve developed a system that can accurately detect and interpret sign language gestures in real-time. This innovation has the potential to transform how we interact, making communication seamless and more accessible for everyone.

I worked with five incredible teammates to make this project a reality, and our efforts secured us 2nd place at our university's 'Innovation Fest'!

- **Technologies Used:** Python, Machine Learning, OpenCV
- **My Contributions:**
  - Programming of detection algorithms
  - Collecting and preprocessing invaluable datasets to train our models
  - Ensuring real-time performance for practical usability
- **GitHub Repo:** [Sign-Language Detection](https://github.com/naeem0512/Sign-Language)

### Data Visualization of Global Terror Attacks
**Project Overview:**
Data tells a story, and with the right tools, we can uncover the narratives hidden within. This project focuses on exploring global terror attacks through data visualization. Additionally, a 'shiny' app was created to allow users to interactively explore features of the data around the world.

- **Technologies Used**: R, Shiny, Data Visualization
- **My Contributions**:
  - Conducting thorough data analysis using R
  - Creating insightful visualizations that make data speak
  - Developing a 'shiny' app for interactive data exploration

#### Report and Script
- [R Project File](./Assessment%202%20-%20Data%20Visualisation.Rproj): The project file for RStudio.(Contains the script containing all data processing and visualization code.)
- [Data Visualization Report](./Assessment_2_Data_VisualisationReport.pdf): A comprehensive report detailing the findings and visualizations.


#### Data Files
**These files were used to explore and analyze the data:**

#### Global Terrorism Database (from Kaggle)
The Global Terrorism Database is a large dataset that was too big to upload as a single file on GitHub. Therefore, it has been split into smaller chunks for easier handling and upload. Below are the links to each chunk of the dataset:

- [Part 1](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part1.csv)
- [Part 2](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part2.csv)
- [Part 3](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part3.csv)
- [Part 4](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part4.csv)
- [Part 5](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part5.csv)
- [Part 6](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part6.csv)
- [Part 7](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part7.csv)
- [Part 8](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part8.csv)
- [Part 9](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part9.csv)
- [Part 10](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part10.csv)
- [Part 11](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part11.csv)
- [Part 12](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part12.csv)
- [Part 13](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part13.csv)
- [Part 14](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part14.csv)
- [Part 15](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part15.csv)
- [Part 16](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part16.csv)


#### Population Data (from World Bank)
The population data from the World Bank was utilized to compare the number of terror attacks with the population of each country, allowing for a fair ratio analysis and deeper insights.
- [World Bank Population Data](./API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_344555.csv): Used to compare terror attacks with country populations for a fair ratio analysis.

### Note
The Global Terrorism Database was sourced from Kaggle. Due to its size, it was split into multiple parts to comply with GitHub's file size limits. Each part can be downloaded and reassembled as needed for analysis. The population data from the World Bank was used to contextualize the data by comparing the number of terror attacks to the population of each country.
