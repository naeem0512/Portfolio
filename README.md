## Projects

### Sign-Language Detection
This project leverages machine learning to enable the detection of sign language gestures. I actively contributed to the programming aspects, crafting algorithms to improve detection accuracy. Additionally, I was involved in the collection of datasets which were vital for training our models.

- **Technologies Used:** Python, Machine Learning, OpenCV
- **My Contributions:**
  - Programming of detection algorithms
  - Collection and preprocessing of dataset
- **GitHub Repo:** [Sign-Language Detection](https://github.com/naeem0512/Sign-Language)

### Data Visualization Assessment
**Project Overview:**
Data tells a story, and with the right tools, we can uncover the narratives hidden within. This project is all about turning raw data into compelling visual stories that drive insights and decision-making.

- **Technologies Used**: R, Data Visualization
- **My Contributions**:
  - Conducting thorough data analysis using R
  - Creating insightful visualizations that make data speak

#### Files
- [World Bank Population Data](./API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_344555.csv): Used to compare terror attacks with country populations for a fair ratio analysis.
- [R Project File](./Assessment%202%20-%20Data%20Visualisation.Rproj): The project file for RStudio.
- [Data Visualization Report](./Assessment_2_Data_VisualisationReport.pdf): A comprehensive report detailing the findings and visualizations.
- [R Script](./Assessment2.R): The script containing all data processing and visualization code.

### Global Terrorism Database (from Kaggle)
**Project Overview:**
Understanding global terrorism trends is crucial for developing strategies to combat threats. This extensive database provides deep insights into terrorist activities worldwide.

Due to the size of this dataset, it has been split into manageable chunks for easier handling.

#### Chunked Data Files
- [Part 1](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part1.csv)
- [Part 2](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part2.csv)
- [Part 3](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part3.csv)
- [Part 4](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part4.csv)
- [Part 5](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part5.csv)
- [Part 6](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part6.csv)
- [Part 7](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part7.csv)
- [Part 8](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part8.csv)
- [Part 9](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part9.csv)
- [Part 10](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part10.csv)
- [Part 11](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part11.csv)
- [Part 12](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part12.csv)
- [Part 13](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part13.csv)
- [Part 14](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part14.csv)
- [Part 15](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part15.csv)
- [Part 16](./csv_chunks/globalterrorismdb_0718dist_part16.csv)

### Additional Data
#### Population Data (from World Bank)
The population data from the World Bank was utilized to compare the number of terror attacks with the population of each country, allowing for a fair ratio analysis and deeper insights.

### Note
The Global Terrorism Database was sourced from Kaggle. Due to its size, it was split into multiple parts to comply with GitHub's file size limits. Each part can be downloaded and reassembled as needed for analysis. The population data from the World Bank was used to contextualize the data by comparing the number of terror attacks to the population of each country.
